    "Q1. Linear regression and logistic regression are both popular techniques used in machine learning for different types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression: Linear regression is used for predicting continuous numerical values. It establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. For example, predicting house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression: Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used for binary classification problems where the target variable has two possible outcomes (e.g., yes/no, true/false, 0/1). It models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. For example, predicting whether an email is spam or not based on features like sender, subject, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenarios where the outcome is binary or categorical, logistic regression would be more appropriate. For instance, predicting whether a customer will churn (yes/no), whether a transaction is fraudulent (yes/no), whether a patient has a disease (yes/no), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. The cost function used in logistic regression is called the log loss or binary cross-entropy loss. It measures the difference between the actual class labels and the predicted probabilities for each instance.\n",

    "Q3. Regularization in logistic regression is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function. The two common types of regularization used are L1 regularization (Lasso regression) and L2 regularization (Ridge regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization: Adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the cost function, which encourages sparsity in the model by shrinking some coefficients to zero. It helps in feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 Regularization: Adds the squared magnitudes of the coefficients to the cost function, which penalizes large coefficients. It helps in reducing the complexity of the model and prevents overfitting.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q4. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positive Rate (TPR), also known as sensitivity or recall, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total actual positive instances.\n",
    "False Positive Rate (FPR) is the ratio of incorrectly predicted positive instances to the total actual negative instances.\n",
    "The ROC curve plots TPR against FPR at various threshold settings. AUC (Area Under the Curve) is used to quantify the performance of the classifier. Higher AUC indicates better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Some common techniques for feature selection in logistic regression include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward Selection: Start with an empty set of features and iteratively add the most significant features until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "Backward Elimination: Start with all features and iteratively remove the least significant features until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Recursively remove the least significant features until the desired number of features is reached.\n",
    "L1 Regularization (Lasso): Use L1 regularization to automatically shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "These techniques help improve the model's performance by reducing overfitting, improving interpretability, and reducing computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Handling imbalanced datasets in logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling Techniques: Oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class to balance the dataset.\n",
    "Algorithmic Techniques: Using algorithms that are less sensitive to class imbalance, such as tree-based algorithms or ensemble methods.\n",
    "Cost-sensitive Learning: Modifying the cost function to penalize misclassifications of the minority class more heavily.\n",
    "Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE): Generating synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the dataset.\n",
    "These strategies help address class imbalance issues and improve the model's performance on imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Common issues and challenges in logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity: When independent variables are highly correlated, it can lead to unstable coefficient estimates. Addressed by removing highly correlated variables or using regularization techniques.\n",
